I'm a software engineering student from The Netherlands who loves working on Art & Digital projects in my free time!

You probably know me from

Vencord: The cutest Discord client mod
Vesktop: A custom Discord desktop app
Discord: Social Media Platform

I'm also very passionate about anything Android and Linux related and love messing around with the internals of everything! I probably know my way around the Discord code better than some Discord employees
By sponsoring me you support my work and help me pay for costs like domain, hosting and also life expenses and allow me to spend more time on my projects!

If you would like to claim any of your perks or just talk to me about literally anything, please message me on Discord! You can find me (@peppy010) on the MrSpherical server. Just dm me, my dms are open. (If you cannot message me, it means your dms are closed, make sure they're open in both Discord & Server settings)
